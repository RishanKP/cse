Large Margin Learning in Set to Set Similarity Comparison for
Person Re-identification
Abstract:
Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims at matching images of the same
person across disjoint camera views, which is a challenging problem in
multimedia analysis, multimedia editing and content-based media retrieval
communities. The major challenge lies in how to preserve similarity of the
same person across video footages with large appearance variations, while
discriminating different individuals. To address this problem, conventional
methods usually consider the pairwise similarity between persons by only
measuring the point to point (P2P) distance. Here the propose d technique
uses deep learning to model a novel set to set (S2S) distance, in which the
underline objective focuses on preserving the compactness of intra-class
samples for each camera view, while maximizing the margin between the
intra- class set and inter-class set. The S2S distance metric is consisted of
three terms, namely the class-identity term, the relative distance term and
the regularization term. The class-identity term keeps the intra-class
samples within each camera view gathering together, the relative distance
term maximizes the distance between the intra-class class set and inter-
class set across different camera views, and the regularization term
smoothness the parameters of deep convolutional neural network (CNN).
As a result, the final learned deep model can effectively find out the
matched target to the probe object among various candidates in the video
gallery by learning discriminative and stable feature representations. Using
the CUHK01, CUHK03, PRID2011 and Market1501 benchmark datasets,
extensive comparative evaluations are conducted to demonstrate the
advantages of this method over the state-of-the-art approaches.

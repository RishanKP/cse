Abstract:

Technology seems to be developing at a bewildering rate across the board these days.New smartphones appear all the time, more sophisticated apps emerge routinely, andcomputers continue to evolve. But aside from the innovations are used to seeing daily, thefield of robotics is advancing at a similar rate: Robotics is a domain in artificial intelligencethat deals with the study of creating intelligent and efficient robots. Robots are aimed atmanipulating the objects by perceiving, picking, moving, modifying the physical properties ofobject, destroying it, or to have an effect thereby freeing manpower from doing repetitivefunctions without getting bored, distracted, or exhausted. As an emergent research area bywhich swarm intelligence is applied to multi- robot systems; swarm robotics (a veryparticular and peculiar sub-area of collective robotics) studies how to coordinate largegroups of relatively simple robots through the use of local rules. Swarm robotics focuses onstudying the design of large amount of relatively simple robots, their physical bodies andtheir controlling behaviors. Since its introduction in 2000, several successful experimentations had been realized, and till now more projects are under investigations.

An Overview of Swarm Robotics:
Swarm Intelligence Applied to

Multi-robotics

Abstract

Technology seems to be developing at a bewildering rate across the board these days.
New smartphones appear all the time, more sophisticated apps emerge routinely, and
computers continue to evolve. But aside from the innovations are used to seeing daily, the
field of robotics is advancing at a similar rate: Robotics is a domain in artificial intelligence
that deals with the study of creating intelligent and efficient robots. Robots are aimed at
manipulating the objects by perceiving, picking, moving, modifying the physical properties of
object, destroying it, or to have an effect thereby freeing manpower from doing repetitive
functions without getting bored, distracted, or exhausted. As an emergent research area by
which swarm intelligence is applied to multi- robot systems; swarm robotics (a very
particular and peculiar sub-area of collective robotics) studies how to coordinate large
groups of relatively simple robots through the use of local rules. Swarm robotics focuses on
studying the design of large amount of relatively simple robots, their physical bodies and
their controlling behaviors. Since its introduction in 2000, several successful
experimentations had been realized, and till now more projects are under investigations.

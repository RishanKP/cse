Using Machine Learning to Detect Fake Identities: Bots vs Humans
ABSTRACT:
There is a growing number of people who hold accounts on social media plat-forms (SMPs)
but hide their identity for malicious purposes. Unfortunately, very little research has been
done to date to detect fake identities created by humans, especially so on SMPs. In contrast,
many examples exist of cases where fake accounts created by bots or computers have been
detected success-fully using machine learning models. In the case of bots these machine
learning models were dependent on employing engineered features such as the ’friend-to-
followers ratio’. These features were engineered from attributes, such as ’friend-count’ and
’follower-count’, which are directly available in the account profiles on SMPs. The methods
discussed in this seminar applies these same engineered features to a set of fake human
accounts in the hope of advancing the successful detection of fake identities created by
humans on SMPs.

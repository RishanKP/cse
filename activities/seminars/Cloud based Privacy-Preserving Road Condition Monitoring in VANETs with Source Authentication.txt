Abstract:
The VANET(vehicular ad-hoc network) and cloud computing technologiesallows entities inVANET to enjoy the advantageous storage and computing servicesoffered by some cloud service provider.In this article, we investigate the cloud-basedroad condition monitoring (RCoM) scenario, where the authority needs to monitorreal-time road conditions with the help of a cloud server so that it could make soundresponses to emergency cases timely. When some bad road condition is detected, e.g.,some geologic hazard or accident happens, vehicles on site are able to report suchinformation to a cloud server engaged by the authority. We focus on addressing threekey issues in RCoM. First, the vehicles have to be authorized by some roadside unitbefore generating a road condition report in the domain and uploading it to the cloudserver. Second, to guarantee the privacy against the cloud server, the road conditioninformation should be reported in ciphertext format, whichrequires that the cloudserver should be able to distinguish the reported data from different vehicles inciphertext format for the same place without compromising their confidentiality.Third,the cloud server and authority should be able to validate the report source, i.e., tocheck whether the road conditions are reported by legitimate vehicles

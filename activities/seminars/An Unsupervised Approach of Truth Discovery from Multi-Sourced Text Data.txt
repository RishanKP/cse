Abstract:
Truth discovery methods aim to identify which piece of information is trustworthy frommulti-sourced data. Most existing truth discovery methods, however, are designed forstructured data and fail to meet the strong need to extract trustworthy information from rawtext data. More specifically, existing methods ignore the semantic information of text answers,i.e., answers may contain multiple factors, the word usages may be diverse, and the answersmay be partially correct. In addition, ubiquitous long-tail phenomenon exists in the tasks, i.e.,most users provide only a few answers and only a few users provide plenty of answers, whichcauses the user reliability estimation for small users to be unreasonable. To tackle thesechallenges, we propose a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based truth discovery modelto automatically discover trustworthy information from text data. Firstly, Smooth InverseFrequency (SIF) is utilized to learn real-valued vector representations for answers. Then, weconstruct undirected graph with these vectors to capture the structural information of answers.Finally, the GCN is utilized to store and update the reliability of these answers, and sums upall the feature vectors of all neighboring answers to improve the accuracy and efficiency oftruth discovery. Different from traditional methods, we use vectors to store the reliability ofanswers which have higher representation capability compared with real numbers, and networkis utilized to capture complex relationships among answers rather than simplified functions.The experiment results on real datasets show that though text data structures are complex, ourmodel can still find reliable answers compared with retrieval-based and state-of-the-art truthdiscovery methods.

Abstract:
With the scope of electronics increasing day by day, the need for utilizing theseadvanced technologies to make human lives simpler is becoming more and morenecessary. The demand for using these technologies to make lives easier fordisabled people is also growing. This has encouraged many new areas of researchand one of the areas is electronic mobility aid for blind. There are a few smartsystems available in the market which uses electronic sensors mounted on the canebut those systems also have certain disadvantages. The Nav Guide is a novelelectronic device to aid outwardly debilitated individuals with obstacle in freewayfinding. The importance of the Nav Guide system is that it provides easyinformation on the surrounding environment and deduces priority informationwithout causing information overload. The priority information is provided to theuser via vibration and audio feedback mechanisms. The proof-of-concept devicecomprises of an Arduino with ultrasonic sensors, vibration motors, and a battery.The assessment results display that NavGuide is a valuable guide in the location ofimpediments, wet floors and ascending staircases. The proposed system guides theblind to detect fire and current passing and it also gives the line following guidance.

DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF ELECTRONIC AID FOR
VISUALLY IMPAIRED PEOPLE
Abstract
With the scope of electronics increasing day by day, the need for utilizing these
advanced technologies to make human lives simpler is becoming more and more
necessary. The demand for using these technologies to make lives easier for
disabled people is also growing. This has encouraged many new areas of research
and one of the areas is electronic mobility aid for blind. There are a few smart
systems available in the market which uses electronic sensors mounted on the cane
but those systems also have certain disadvantages. The Nav Guide is a novel
electronic device to aid outwardly debilitated individuals with obstacle in freeway
finding. The importance of the Nav Guide system is that it provides easy
information on the surrounding environment and deduces priority information
without causing information overload. The priority information is provided to the
user via vibration and audio feedback mechanisms. The proof-of-concept device
comprises of an Arduino with ultrasonic sensors, vibration motors, and a battery.
The assessment results display that NavGuide is a valuable guide in the location of
impediments, wet floors and ascending staircases. The proposed system guides the
blind to detect fire and current passing and it also gives the line following guidance.

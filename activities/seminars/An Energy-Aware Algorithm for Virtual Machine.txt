Abstract:
Virtualization technology, as a key technology in cloud computing, makes the virtual machineplacement (VMP) play an important role in improving the energy efficiency of data centers.In this paper, an energy-aware algorithm named GATA is proposed for the VMP problem. Itcombines the genetic algorithm with the tabu search algorithm. The goal is to obtain anoptimal VMP scheme to achieve energy efficiency while maximizing load balance amongvarious resources. The algorithm is compared with two meta-heuristic algorithms and a newlyproposed algorithm that is based on ant colony algorithm. The execution time of thesealgorithms is also discussed. The results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to thosemethods mentioned above.

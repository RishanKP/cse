DETECTION METHOD FOR
SPOOFED IP AGAINST
DDOS ATTACKS
Abstract
Cybercriminals are learning to harness the power of simpler devices like con-
nected cameras. In September of 2016, Mirai software was used to infect
more than 100,000 devices and unleash one of the largest distributed denial-
of-service (DDoS) attacks up to that time. After this incident, many people
identified multiple large attacks coming from Internet of Things (IoT) devices,
like CCTV cameras, and described these attacks as a new trend. A technique
to detect whether a signal source is counterfeited in the initial stage of a DDoS
attack is important. This paper proposes a method for the quick detection of a
spoofed Internet protocol (IP) during a DDoS attack based on a DDoS shelter
that is established to defend against DDoS attacks. In order to achieve this
goal, the proposed method evaluate the number of time-to-live hops in normal
traffic as a reference for the bandwidth of each network that is accessible to
the DDoS shelter

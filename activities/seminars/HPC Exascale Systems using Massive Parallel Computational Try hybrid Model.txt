HPC Exascale Systems using Massive Parallel
Computational Tri hybrid Model
Abstract
The emerging high-performance computing Exascale supercomputing system, which is
anticipated to be available in 2020, will unravel many scientific mysteries. A new tri-hybrid MOC
(MPI + OpenMP + CUDA) parallel programming model attained massive performance through
monolithic parallelism in the system. Huge parallelism is one of these challenges, which
requires a novel low power consuming parallel programming approach for attaining massive
performance. In order to evaluate MOC model, it is implemented in linear algebraic dense
matrix multiplication application and observed different metrics such as performance and
power consumption during different dataset executions. This seminar introduces a new parallel
programming model that achieves massive parallelism by combining coarse-grained and fine-
grained parallelism over inter-node and intra node computation, respectively. The proposed
framework is tri-hybrid of MPI, OpenMP, and compute unified device architecture (CUDA) MOC
model that compute input data over heterogeneous framework. It was observed that MOC with
four kernels outperformed against eight and twelve kernels implementations. Further, MOC
with peak performance was compared with other most prominent implementations including
KBLAS and CuBLAS.

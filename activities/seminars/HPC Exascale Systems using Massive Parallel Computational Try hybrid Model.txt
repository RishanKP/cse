Abstract:
The emerging high-performance computing Exascale supercomputing system, which isanticipated to be available in 2020, will unravel many scientific mysteries. A new tri-hybrid MOC(MPI + OpenMP + CUDA) parallel programming model attained massive performance throughmonolithic parallelism in the system. Huge parallelism is one of these challenges, whichrequires a novel low power consuming parallel programming approach for attaining massiveperformance. In order to evaluate MOC model, it is implemented in linear algebraic densematrix multiplication application and observed different metrics such as performance andpower consumption during different dataset executions. This seminar introduces a new parallelprogramming model that achieves massive parallelism by combining coarse-grained and fine-grained parallelism over inter-node and intra node computation, respectively. The proposedframework is tri-hybrid of MPI, OpenMP, and compute unified device architecture (CUDA) MOCmodel that compute input data over heterogeneous framework. It was observed that MOC withfour kernels outperformed against eight and twelve kernels implementations. Further, MOCwith peak performance was compared with other most prominent implementations includingKBLAS and CuBLAS.

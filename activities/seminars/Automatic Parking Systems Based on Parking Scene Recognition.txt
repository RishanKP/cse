Abstract:
Automatic parking technology can complete parking operations safely andquickly without a driver and can improve driving comfort, while greatly reducingthe probability of parking accidents. Existing systems are less intelligent, low degreeof automation, and scope is limited to traditional fuel vehicles. To increase theutilization of parking spaces and parking convenience, machine vision and patternrecognition techniques are introduced to intelligently recognize a vertical parkingscenario, plan a reasonable parking path, develop a path tracking control strategy toimprove the vehicle control automation, and explore a highly intelligent automaticparking technology roadmap. This paper discusses how Visual Sensors can beapplied to auto-parking system and the key aspects of system solutions for anautomatic parking system based on parking scene recognition, parking pathplanning, and path tracking and control.

Automatic Parking Systems Based on Parking Scene Recognition
Abstract:
Automatic parking technology can complete parking operations safely and
quickly without a driver and can improve driving comfort, while greatly reducing
the probability of parking accidents. Existing systems are less intelligent, low degree
of automation, and scope is limited to traditional fuel vehicles. To increase the
utilization of parking spaces and parking convenience, machine vision and pattern
recognition techniques are introduced to intelligently recognize a vertical parking
scenario, plan a reasonable parking path, develop a path tracking control strategy to
improve the vehicle control automation, and explore a highly intelligent automatic
parking technology roadmap. This paper discusses how Visual Sensors can be
applied to auto-parking system and the key aspects of system solutions for an
automatic parking system based on parking scene recognition, parking path
planning, and path tracking and control.

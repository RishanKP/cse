Abstract:
The subpixel-shifted (SPS) images acquisition method based on imagingsystem has the limitations of complex structure, difficult production and high cost.Therefore,an image super-resolution reconstruction method based on registration isproposed. In the first phase, the registration algorithm is used to select the SPSimages. In order to improve the accuracy of the registration algorithm, a registrationalgorithm combining SIFT-FLANN and misregistration points elimination (SFME)is proposed. In the second phase, an interpolation of nonuniformly spaced samplesbased on pixel gray correction is proposed to get the high resolution (HR) image.Experiments show that the images selection method can obtain higher-precision SPSimages, and the reconstruction method can reconstruct HR image with better visualand higher spatial resolution. Finally, the image magnification factor and the numberof SPS images used in the reconstruction process are analyzed to describe thepractical application value of the methods proposed.

Using Crowdsourcing to Provide QoS for Mobile Cloud Computing
ABSTRACT  Quality of cloudservice(QoS) is one of the crucial factors for the success of cloud providers in mobile cloudcomputing.Context-awareness is a popular method for automatic awareness of the mobile environment and choosing the most suitable cloudprovider.Lack of context information may harm the users' confidence in the application rendering it useless.Thus,mobile devices  need to be constantly aware of the  environment and to test the performance of ea ch cloudprovider,which is inefficient and wastes energy.Crowdsourcing is a considerable technology to discover and select cloudservices inorder to provide intelligent,efficient,and stable discovering of services for mobileusers based on groupchoice.This article introduces a crowdsourcing-based QoS supported mobilecloud service framework that fulfills mobile users' satisfaction by sensing their context information and providing appropriate services to each of the users.Based on user's activity context,socialcontext,servicecontext,and devicecontext,ourframework dynamically adapts cloudservice for the requests in different kinds of scenarios.The context-awareness based management approach efficiency achieves are liable cloudservice supported platform to supply the QualityofService on mobiledevice

Abstract:
Personal health records (PHRs) are private and vital assets for every patient. Therehave been introduced many works on various aspects of managing and organizing the PHR sofar. However, there is an uncertain remaining issue for the role of PHR in emergencies. In atraditional emergency access system, the patient cannot give consent to emergency staff foraccessing his/her PHR. Moreover, there is no secured record management of patientâ€™s PHR,which reveals highly confidential personal information, such as what happened, when, andwho has access to such information. This paper proposes an emergency access controlmanagement system (EACMS) based on permissioned blockchain hyperledger fabric andhyperledger composer. In the proposed system, we defined some rules using the smartcontracts for emergency condition and time duration for the emergency access PHR dataitems that patient can assign some limitations for controlling the PHR permissions.analyzed the performance of our proposed framework by implementing through thehyperledger composer based on the response time, privacy, security, and accessibility. Theexperiments confirm that our framework provides better efficiency compared with thetraditional emergency access system.

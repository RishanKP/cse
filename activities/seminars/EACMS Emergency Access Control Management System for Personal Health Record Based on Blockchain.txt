EACMS: Emergency Access Control Management
System for Personal Health Record
Based on Blockchain
Abstract
Personal health records (PHRs) are private and vital assets for every patient. There
have been introduced many works on various aspects of managing and organizing the PHR so
far. However, there is an uncertain remaining issue for the role of PHR in emergencies. In a
traditional emergency access system, the patient cannot give consent to emergency staff for
accessing his/her PHR. Moreover, there is no secured record management of patientâ€™s PHR,
which reveals highly confidential personal information, such as what happened, when, and
who has access to such information. This paper proposes an emergency access control
management system (EACMS) based on permissioned blockchain hyperledger fabric and
hyperledger composer. In the proposed system, we defined some rules using the smart
contracts for emergency condition and time duration for the emergency access PHR data
items that patient can assign some limitations for controlling the PHR permissions.
analyzed the performance of our proposed framework by implementing through the
hyperledger composer based on the response time, privacy, security, and accessibility. The
experiments confirm that our framework provides better efficiency compared with the
traditional emergency access system.

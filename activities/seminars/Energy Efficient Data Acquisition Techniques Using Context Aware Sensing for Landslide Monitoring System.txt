Energy Efficient Data Acquisition Techniques
Using Context Aware Sensing For Landslide
Monitoring System
Abstract
Real- Time wireless sensor networks is an emerging technology for continuous
environmental monitoring. But real world deployments are constrained by
resources such as power, memory, and processing capabilities. In this paper,
we discuss a set of techniques to maximize the lifetime of a system deployed
in south India for detecting rain-fall induced landslides. In this system, the
sensing subsystem consumes 77.5%, the communication subsystem consumes
22%, and the processing subsystem consumes 0.45% of total power
consumption. Hence, to maximize the lifetime of the system, the sensing
subsystem power consumption has to be reduced. The major challenge to
address is the development of techniques that reduce the power consumption
while preserving the reliability of data collection and decision support by the
system. This research work proposes a wavelet based sampling algorithm for
choosing the minimum sampling rate for ensuring the data reliability. The
results from the wavelet sampling algorithm along with the domain knowledge
have been used to develop context aware data collection models that enhance
the lifetime of the system. Two such models named Context Aware Data
Management (CAD) and Context Aware Energy Management (CAE) have
been devised. The results show that the CAD model extends the lifetime by six
times and the CAE model does so by 20 times when compared to the
Continuous Data Collection (CDC) model, which is the existing approach. In
this work, we also developed mathematical modeling for CAD and CAE,
which have been validated using real-time data collected

Abstract:
Real- Time wireless sensor networks is an emerging technology for continuousenvironmental monitoring. But real world deployments are constrained byresources such as power, memory, and processing capabilities. In this paper,we discuss a set of techniques to maximize the lifetime of a system deployedin south India for detecting rain-fall induced landslides. In this system, thesensing subsystem consumes 77.5%, the communication subsystem consumes22%, and the processing subsystem consumes 0.45% of total powerconsumption. Hence, to maximize the lifetime of the system, the sensingsubsystem power consumption has to be reduced. The major challenge toaddress is the development of techniques that reduce the power consumptionwhile preserving the reliability of data collection and decision support by thesystem. This research work proposes a wavelet based sampling algorithm forchoosing the minimum sampling rate for ensuring the data reliability. Theresults from the wavelet sampling algorithm along with the domain knowledgehave been used to develop context aware data collection models that enhancethe lifetime of the system. Two such models named Context Aware DataManagement (CAD) and Context Aware Energy Management (CAE) havebeen devised. The results show that the CAD model extends the lifetime by sixtimes and the CAE model does so by 20 times when compared to theContinuous Data Collection (CDC) model, which is the existing approach. Inthis work, we also developed mathematical modeling for CAD and CAE,which have been validated using real-time data collected

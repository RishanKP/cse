Abstract:
Pervasive computing environments (PvCE) are embedded with interconnectedsmart devices which provide users with services desired. As the service compo-sition environment may be dynamic and large scale, centralized service com-position algorithm is usually inefficient due to message cost.In this localizedservice composition algorithm (LASEC), UIOs collaborate with each other ina bottom-up, localized manner to compose required service without requiringglobal knowledge.The proposed localized service composition algorithm (LASEC) in the givenpaper, UIOs collaborate with each other in a bottom-up, localized mannerto compose required service without requiring global knowledge. To solve theproblem of blind compositions in LASEC, we propose a novel mechanism calledAlien-information-based Acknowledging (A-Ack), in which a UIO decides oncollaborating with another UIO only after obtaining some additional infor-mation from the collaboration candidate. Specifically,this information refersto ability of a given UIO to compose another part of the service. ProposedLASEC is message-efficient and quality-guaranteed. Extensive simulations ofLASEC as well as existing decentralized and pull-based centralized algorithmshave been conducted. The results show the relatively low communication costand composition time of LASEC.

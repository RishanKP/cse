LASEC: A Localized Approach To
Service Composition In Pervasive
Computing Enviornments
Abstract
Pervasive computing environments (PvCE) are embedded with interconnected
smart devices which provide users with services desired. As the service compo-
sition environment may be dynamic and large scale, centralized service com-
position algorithm is usually inefficient due to message cost.In this localized
service composition algorithm (LASEC), UIOs collaborate with each other in
a bottom-up, localized manner to compose required service without requiring
global knowledge.
The proposed localized service composition algorithm (LASEC) in the given
paper, UIOs collaborate with each other in a bottom-up, localized manner
to compose required service without requiring global knowledge. To solve the
problem of blind compositions in LASEC, we propose a novel mechanism called
Alien-information-based Acknowledging (A-Ack), in which a UIO decides on
collaborating with another UIO only after obtaining some additional infor-
mation from the collaboration candidate. Specifically,this information refers
to ability of a given UIO to compose another part of the service. Proposed
LASEC is message-efficient and quality-guaranteed. Extensive simulations of
LASEC as well as existing decentralized and pull-based centralized algorithms
have been conducted. The results show the relatively low communication cost
and composition time of LASEC.

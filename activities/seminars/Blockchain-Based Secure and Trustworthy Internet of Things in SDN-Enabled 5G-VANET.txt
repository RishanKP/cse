Abstract:
The modern intelligent transportation system brings not only new opportuni-ties for vehicular Internet of Things (IoT ) services but also new challenges forvehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) . Apart from enhanced network perfor-mance, a practical and reliable security scheme is needed to handle t he trustmanagement while preserving user privacy at the same time. The emerging5G mobile communication system is viewed as a prominent technology forultra-reliable, low-latency wireless communication services. Fur t hermore, in-corporating software-defined network (SON) architecture into the 5G-VANETenables global information gathering and network control. Hence, real-timeIoT services on transportation monitoring and reporting can be well sup-ported. Both pave the way for an innovative vehicular security scheme. Thereare several security and privacy issue in the transportation system and thevehicular IoT environment in SDN-enabled 5G-VANET. Due to t he decen-tralized and immutable characteristics of blockchain, a blockchain-based se-curity framework is designed to support the vehicular IoT services, i.e. , real-time cloud-based video report and trust management on vehicular messages.So a SDN-enabled 5G-VANET model and the scheduling procedures of theblockchain-based framework can tackle t he issues in t he trans portation system.The numerical simulation results also s how that malicious vehkular nodes ormessages can be weU detected while the overhead and impact on the networkperformance are acceptable for large-scale scenarios. Through case studies andtheoretical analysis, this design guarantees a secure and trustwort hy vehicularIoT environment with user privacy preserved.Keywords: Blockchain, 5G-VANET, IoT , security and privacy, SDN , trust

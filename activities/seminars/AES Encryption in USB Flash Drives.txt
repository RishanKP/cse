AES ENCRYPTION IN USB FLASH DRIVES
Abstract:
A USB flash drive is a data storage device that consists of flash memory with an integrated Universal
Serial Bus (USB) interface. A Cloud Storage is also a similar case where in the data is stored remotely
and is accessed whenever needed. There are many more drawbacks like limited storage, no security,
back up, temp files, no remote disable etc. This flash drives are 'limitless' secure USB device that
enables users to access, edit & share all their files & media between any two online computers
anywhere in the world. The only limit is the size of your computer’s hard drive. This usb is an
innovative solution that allows remote file access without the security and privacy risks of the cloud
and USB flash drives. It’s very easy to access as a USB device and no special installation is required.
This uses thoroughly analyzed crypto protocols and algorithms(AES 256 bit encryption). It has
features like bi-directional file access, no temp files, remote disable, smart key generation, and
password support and trust authentication

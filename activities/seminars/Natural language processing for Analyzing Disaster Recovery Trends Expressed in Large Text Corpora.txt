PROCESSING FOR ANALYZING
DISASTER RECOVERY TRENDS
EXPRESSED IN LARGE TEXT
CORPORA
Abstract
In this report, a new natural language processing (NLP) method is devel-
oped to facilitate analysis of text corpora that describe long-term recovery.
The aim of the method is to allow users to measure the degree that user-
specified propositions about potential issues are embodied within the corpora,
serving as a proxy for the disaster recovery process. The presented method em-
ploys a statistical syntax-based semantic matching model and was trained on
a standard, publicly available training dataset.The NLP method is applied to
a news story corpus that describes the recovery of Christchurch, New Zealand
after the 2010â€“2011 Canterbury earthquake sequence.The proposed model is
used to compute semantic measurements of multiple potential recovery issues
as expressed in the Christchurch news corpus that span 2011 to 2016. The
evaluated method outputs through a user study involving twenty professional
emergency managers. User study results show that the model can be effective
when applied to a disaster-related news corpus. 85 % of study participants were
interested in a way to measure recovery issue propositions in news or other cor-
pora.This proposed system can be used in future applications of NLP method
for after-action learning, recovery decision making and disaster research.

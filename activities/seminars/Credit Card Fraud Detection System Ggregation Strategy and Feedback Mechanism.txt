Abstract:
The credit card fraud detection with hidden markov model and anti- k nearest neighbor algorithm didn’t solve the problem pf concept drift. Therefore,in order to solve the problem of concept drift, fraud detection system usingaggregation strategy and feedback mechanism was used. There are mainly 4stages in the methodology. First is preprocessing data in which raw features aretaken and classified into 3 similar groups low, medium and high and after thateach transaction behavior are aggregated using a sliding window. From that fouramount-related features and time-related features are extracted and labelled asnormal or abnormal by using label function. After the preprocessing stageClustering behavioral patterns comes in which we classify all normal features of agroup. After that Classifying behavioral patterns and assignment comes in whichwe first cluster all the abnormal feature and train a set of classifiers whichcontains behavioral patterns and abnormal features by random forest method.After that we update cardholders’ behavioral profile by a feedback mechanism. Arating score is updated with each classifier and if the prediction is wrong thefeedback mechanism is given back in which rating score is decremented. So, ifthere is a sudden change in pattern it is also analyzed by feedback system andupdate the cardholder’s profile.

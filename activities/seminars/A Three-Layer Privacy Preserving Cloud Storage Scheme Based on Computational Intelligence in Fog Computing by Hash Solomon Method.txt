Abstract:
Recent years witness the development of cloud computing technology. With the explosivegrowth of unstructured data, cloud storage technology gets more attention and betterdevelopment. However, in current storage schema, userâ€™s data is totally stored in cloud servers.In other words, users lose their right of control on data and face privacy leakage risk. Traditionalprivacy protection schemes are usually based on encryption technology, but these kinds ofmethods cannot effectively resist attack from the inside of cloud server. In order to solve thisproblem, we propose a three-layer storage framework based on fog computing. The proposedframework can both take full advantage of cloud storage and protect the privacy of data.Besides, Hash-Solomon method is designed to divide data into different parts. Then, we canput a small part of data in local machine and fog server in order to protect the privacy.Moreover, based on computational intelligence, this method can compute the distributionproportion stored in cloud, fog, and local machine, respectively. Through the theoretical safetyanalysis and experimental evaluation, the feasibility of our scheme has been validated, whichis really a powerful supplement to existing cloud storage scheme.

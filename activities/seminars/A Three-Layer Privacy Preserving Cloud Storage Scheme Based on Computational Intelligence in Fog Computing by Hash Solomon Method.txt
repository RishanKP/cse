A Three-Layer Privacy Preserving Cloud Storage Scheme Based on Computational Intelligence
in Fog Computing by Hash Solomon Method
Abstract:
Recent years witness the development of cloud computing technology. With the explosive
growth of unstructured data, cloud storage technology gets more attention and better
development. However, in current storage schema, userâ€™s data is totally stored in cloud servers.
In other words, users lose their right of control on data and face privacy leakage risk. Traditional
privacy protection schemes are usually based on encryption technology, but these kinds of
methods cannot effectively resist attack from the inside of cloud server. In order to solve this
problem, we propose a three-layer storage framework based on fog computing. The proposed
framework can both take full advantage of cloud storage and protect the privacy of data.
Besides, Hash-Solomon method is designed to divide data into different parts. Then, we can
put a small part of data in local machine and fog server in order to protect the privacy.
Moreover, based on computational intelligence, this method can compute the distribution
proportion stored in cloud, fog, and local machine, respectively. Through the theoretical safety
analysis and experimental evaluation, the feasibility of our scheme has been validated, which
is really a powerful supplement to existing cloud storage scheme.

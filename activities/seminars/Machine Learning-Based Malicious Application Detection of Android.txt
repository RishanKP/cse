Machine Learning-Based Malicious Application Detection of
Android
Abstract
In this seminar, a machine learning-based approach which is used to detect
malicious mobile malware in Android applications is presented. This system is
able to capture instantaneous attacks that cannot be effectively detected in
the past work. Based on this approach, this method implements a malicious
app detection tool, named Androidetect. First, the system analyses the
relationship between system functions, sensitive permissions, and sensitive
application programming interfaces. The combination of system functions
has been used to describe the application behaviours and construct
eigenvectors. Subsequently, based on the eigenvectors, the methodologies of
naive Bayesian, J48 decision tree, are compared regarding effective detection
of malicious Android applications. Androidetect is then applied to test sample
programs and real-world applications. The experimental results prove that
Androidetect can better detect malicious applications of Android by using a
combination of system functions compared with the previous work.

Abstract:
In this seminar, a machine learning-based approach which is used to detectmalicious mobile malware in Android applications is presented. This system isable to capture instantaneous attacks that cannot be effectively detected inthe past work. Based on this approach, this method implements a maliciousapp detection tool, named Androidetect. First, the system analyses therelationship between system functions, sensitive permissions, and sensitiveapplication programming interfaces. The combination of system functionshas been used to describe the application behaviours and constructeigenvectors. Subsequently, based on the eigenvectors, the methodologies ofnaive Bayesian, J48 decision tree, are compared regarding effective detectionof malicious Android applications. Androidetect is then applied to test sampleprograms and real-world applications. The experimental results prove thatAndroidetect can better detect malicious applications of Android by using acombination of system functions compared with the previous work.

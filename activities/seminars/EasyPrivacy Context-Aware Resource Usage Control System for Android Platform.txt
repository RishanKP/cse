EasyPrivacy: Context-Aware Resource Usage Control System for Android Platform
Abstract - With the rapid development of the Android platform, numerous applications (apps) are
developed to provide new or enhanced services using resources on mobile devices. On one hand,
these apps can bring convenience for users in context which has little privacy risk. On the other
hand, misuse of these resources by apps may result in privacy leakage in context which has strict
requirements for privacy. Therefore, fine-grained resource usage constraint mechanisms that take
the context information into account are in demand. This paper presents an enhanced context-
aware resource usage control system (EasyPrivacy) in Android to provide adaptive resource usage
control. The main contribution of this paper is -
1. A Context-aware Resource Usage Control System - EasyPrivacy
2. Policy Conflict Consideration
3. Facilitating users to configure policies â€“ TipsTool

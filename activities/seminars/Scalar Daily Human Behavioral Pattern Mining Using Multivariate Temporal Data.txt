Scalar Daily Human Behavioral Pattern Mining
Using Multivariate Temporal Data
Abstract
This work introduces a set of scalable algorithms to identify patterns of human daily
behaviors. These patterns are extracted from multivariate temporal data that have been
collected from smartphones. We have exploited sensors that are available on these devices,
and have identified frequent behavioral patterns with a temporal granularity, which has been
inspired by the way individuals segment time into events. These patterns are helpful to both
end-users and third parties who provide services based on this information. We have
demonstrated our approach on two real-world datasets and showed that our pattern
identification algorithms are scalable. This scalability makes analysis on resource constrained
and small devices such as smartwatches feasible. Traditional data analysis systems are
usually operated in a remote system outside the device. This is largely due to the lack of
scalability originating from software and hardware restrictions of mobile/wearable devices.
By analyzing the data on the device, the user has the control over the data, i.e., privacy, and
the network costs will also be removed.

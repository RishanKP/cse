ABSTRACT:
In the modern era of digital communication a transfer of a secret message is a contestable one.Several methods have been proposed and investigated in the literature to provide privacy forcommunication. Data hiding technique conceals the secret message into cover image, where theimage embedded with secret message, WHICH is being transmitted to prevent the other party frommodifying, intercepting, and tampering, thus protecting the data. This proposes a method ofreversible data hiding in encrypted images (RDH-EI) based on progressive recovery. The aim ofthis work is to hide & retrieve back the data in encrypted images.Three parties are involved in the framework, including the content owner, the data-hider, and therecipient. The content owner encrypts the original image using a stream cipher algorithm anduploads ciphertext to the server. The data-hider on the server divides the encrypted image into threechannels and respectively embeds different amount of additional bits into each one to generate amarked encrypted image. On the recipient side, additional message can be extracted from themarked encrypted image, and the original image can be recovered without any errors. While mostof the traditional methods use one criterion to recover the whole image, we propose to do therecovery by a progressive mechanism. Rate-distortion of the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art RDH-EI methods.

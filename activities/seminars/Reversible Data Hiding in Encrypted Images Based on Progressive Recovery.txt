REVERSIBLE DATA HIDING IN ENCRYPTED IMAGES BASED ON PROGRESSIVE
RECOVERY
ABSTRACT:
In the modern era of digital communication a transfer of a secret message is a contestable one.
Several methods have been proposed and investigated in the literature to provide privacy for
communication. Data hiding technique conceals the secret message into cover image, where the
image embedded with secret message, WHICH is being transmitted to prevent the other party from
modifying, intercepting, and tampering, thus protecting the data. This proposes a method of
reversible data hiding in encrypted images (RDH-EI) based on progressive recovery. The aim of
this work is to hide & retrieve back the data in encrypted images.
Three parties are involved in the framework, including the content owner, the data-hider, and the
recipient. The content owner encrypts the original image using a stream cipher algorithm and
uploads ciphertext to the server. The data-hider on the server divides the encrypted image into three
channels and respectively embeds different amount of additional bits into each one to generate a
marked encrypted image. On the recipient side, additional message can be extracted from the
marked encrypted image, and the original image can be recovered without any errors. While most
of the traditional methods use one criterion to recover the whole image, we propose to do the
recovery by a progressive mechanism. Rate-distortion of the proposed method outperforms state-of-
the-art RDH-EI methods.

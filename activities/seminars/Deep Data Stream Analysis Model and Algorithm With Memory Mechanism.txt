ABSTRACT:
Integrated analysis is an important method for data analysis. Aimed at improving thedeficiencies of traditional integrated data stream analysis, a human-like remembering andforgetting mechanism is introduced into data stream analysis, and a deep data streamanalysis model based on remembering (DSAR) is proposed. Through this rememberingand forgetting mechanism, the model regards basic classifiers as system-obtainedknowledge and not only stores useful basic classifiers in a ``remembering library'' toimprove prediction stability but also selects good basic classifiers to participate inintegrated prediction, thus improving its ability to accommodate conceptual variations.Based on the DSAR model, an integrated deep data stream analysis (DDSA) algorithm isproposed. The algorithm uses the forgetting curve and a selective ensemble classifier tosimulate human thinking. Compared with four typical data stream analysis algorithms,the DDSA algorithm has a high classification accuracy and a strong capacity foraccommodating concept drift features (CDFs) within data stream analysis. Classificationis an important application in the field of data analysis. The classical problems mainlyadopt static batch processing that is, all the training data is submitted to the learningsystem. However, as application fields acquire ever increasing amounts of data, theability of learning systems to learn dynamically is also becoming increasingly important

Blue Brain
Abstract:
Blue brain is a supercomputer programmed such that it can function as an artificial brain,
which can also be called a virtual brain. IBM is developing this virtual brain which would
be the world’s first such created machine. Its main aim is to create a machine in which
the information of the actual brain can be uploaded. This would ensure that a person’s
knowledge, personality, memories, and intelligence are preserved and safe. The Blue
Brain project utilizes the technologies of reverse engineering and artificial intelligence at
its core and is implemented through the use of supercomputers and nanobots. The Blue
Brain project is centered towards finding viable solutions to brain-disorders, a working
model close to the actual brain which would help in greater understanding of the human
brain and the human mind and the state of consciousness, a step towards building an
independently thinking machine, and finally collecting information of hundreds of years
from the human brains and storing it in the form of a databases. The Blue Brain project
mimics the human brain by acquiring the data from its surrounding through special
software, interpreting through neural electrophysiology and morphology, and simulating
them on computers. Thus, The Blue Brain project is a powerful tool for the study and
analysis of the human brain and for the advancement of the human brain and society.

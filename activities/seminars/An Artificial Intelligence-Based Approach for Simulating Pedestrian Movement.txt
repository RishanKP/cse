An Artificial Intelligence-Based Approach for Simulating Pedestrian
Movement
Abstract:
This paper proposes a novel approach for simulating pedestrian movement behavior
based on artificial intelligence technology. Within this approach, a large volume of
microscopic pedestrian movement behavior types were collected and encapsulated
into an artificial neural network via network training. The trained network was then
fed back into a simulation environment to predict the pedestrian movement. Two
simulation experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the approach.
First, a pedestrian-collision-avoidance test was conducted, and the results showed
that virtual pedestrians with learned pedestrian behavior can move reasonably to
avoid potential collisions with other pedestrians. In addition, a critical parameter, i.e.,
defined as “reacting distance” and determined to be 2.5 m, represented the boundary
of the collision buffer zone. Second, a pedestrian counterflow in a road-crossing
situation was simulated, and the results were compared with the real-life scenario.
The comparison revealed that the pedestrian distributions, erratic trajectories, and
density–speed fundamental diagram in the simulation are reasonably consistent with
the real-life scenario. Furthermore, a quantitative indicator, i.e., the relative distance
error, was calculated to evaluate the simulation error of pedestrians’ trajectories
between the simulation and the real-life scenario.We considered the proposed
approach to be capable of simulating human-like microscopic pedestrian flow.

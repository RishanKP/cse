Secure IoT using Cloud
Abstract

In an IoT system the level of risking our data depends on to which extent we consume the
service provided by that system. Putting trust in a system, where the serving entity and served
entity is often unknown is a hard decision. Furthermore, interoperability and scalability of
billions of heterogeneous devices in an IoT system requires special attention. ARCA-IoT is a
system which identifies the attributes essential for trust and also presents a user-centric model
that is robust enough to tackle the attacks made by dishonest entities to manipulate the
trustworthiness. For scalability and interoperability, a cloud-assisted environment is
introduced in the ARCA-IoT. An intuitive Naive Bayes approach is used to train the ARCA-
IoT in a way that it calculates the probabilities of the trustworthiness of the entities and then
identifies various types of attacks with the support of three proposed algorithms.

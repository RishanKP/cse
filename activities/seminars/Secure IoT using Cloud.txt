Abstract:

In an IoT system the level of risking our data depends on to which extent we consume theservice provided by that system. Putting trust in a system, where the serving entity and servedentity is often unknown is a hard decision. Furthermore, interoperability and scalability ofbillions of heterogeneous devices in an IoT system requires special attention. ARCA-IoT is asystem which identifies the attributes essential for trust and also presents a user-centric modelthat is robust enough to tackle the attacks made by dishonest entities to manipulate thetrustworthiness. For scalability and interoperability, a cloud-assisted environment isintroduced in the ARCA-IoT. An intuitive Naive Bayes approach is used to train the ARCA-IoT in a way that it calculates the probabilities of the trustworthiness of the entities and thenidentifies various types of attacks with the support of three proposed algorithms.

A Novel Method for Carbon Dioxide Emission Forecasting Based on Improved
Gaussian Processes Regression
Abstract:
The fact that global warming will bring impact on immigration, agriculture and also
generate human conflicts is becoming a focus in climate change topic and the forecasting of
carbon dioxide emission has been attracting much attention.Here,we proposed an improved
Gaussian processes regression method for carbon dioxide emission forecasting based on a
modified PSO algorithm which can efficiently optimize the hyper parameters of covariance
function in the Gaussian processes regression. Also we tested our improved PSO-GPR method
with the total carbon dioxide emissions data of U.S., China and Japan in 1980-2012, and
compared the prediction precision of our method with original GPR and BP Neural Networks by
the data of U.S., China and Japan. The performance of our improved Gaussian processes
regression method enhanced the prediction accuracy of original GPR method and is superior to
other traditional forecasting method like BP Neural Networks.

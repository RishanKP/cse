Abstract:
Long-term wellbeing monitoring is an underlying theme for evaluating health statusby collecting physiological signs through behavioral traits. In alignment with internet ofthings (IoT), non-intrusive and trustworthy wearable social sensing technology holds apotential way for researchers to find and establish the interrelationships betweenunobtrusive social cues and physical mental health (PMH). This paper implements an IoTstructured wearable social sensing platform with the integration of privacy audio feature,behavior monitoring and environment sensing in a naturalistic environment. Particularly,four privacy protected audio-wellbeing features are embedded into the platform toautomatically evaluate speech information without preserving raw audio data.

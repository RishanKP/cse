IOT structured Long-term Wearable Social Sensing for Mental Wellbeing
Abstract
Long-term wellbeing monitoring is an underlying theme for evaluating health status
by collecting physiological signs through behavioral traits. In alignment with internet of
things (IoT), non-intrusive and trustworthy wearable social sensing technology holds a
potential way for researchers to find and establish the interrelationships between
unobtrusive social cues and physical mental health (PMH). This paper implements an IoT
structured wearable social sensing platform with the integration of privacy audio feature,
behavior monitoring and environment sensing in a naturalistic environment. Particularly,
four privacy protected audio-wellbeing features are embedded into the platform to
automatically evaluate speech information without preserving raw audio data.

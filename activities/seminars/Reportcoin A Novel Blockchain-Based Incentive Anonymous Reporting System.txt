Reportcoin: A Novel Blockchain-Based Incentive
Anonymous Reporting System
Abstract
In our current age and society, sending messages is an extremely simple and an
important part of our lives. This is often used in city management. But, only a few people are
willing to reflect or report some violations of law and discipline around them, and more
people choose to ignore. There are two major reasons for this. First, reporting with a real
name is recommended. But it is difficult to send trusted and reliable information without
revealing the sender’s identity. Second, no benefit. People usually lack the motivation to
report crimes in fear of retaliation. For example, reporting a drug dealer may cause harm for
the reporter’s self or family. In this, an effective and efficient reporting system called
Reportcoin, a novel blockchain-based incentive anonymous reporting system. ReportCoin
guarantees user identity privacy and reporting message reliability throughout the reporting
process. On the one hand, ReportCoin allows nondeterministic mobile users to vote the
reporting by signing and to send anonymous announcements in the non-fully trusted network.
On the other hand, ReportCoin motivates users with incentives to report without worrying
about the disclosure of identity information to be retaliated. Meanwhile, account information
and transaction records in ReportCoin are open, transparent, and tamper resistant. The
theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results show that ReportCoin is efficient and
practical

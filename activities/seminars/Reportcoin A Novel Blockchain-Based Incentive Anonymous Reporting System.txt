Abstract:
In our current age and society, sending messages is an extremely simple and animportant part of our lives. This is often used in city management. But, only a few people arewilling to reflect or report some violations of law and discipline around them, and morepeople choose to ignore. There are two major reasons for this. First, reporting with a realname is recommended. But it is difficult to send trusted and reliable information withoutrevealing the sender’s identity. Second, no benefit. People usually lack the motivation toreport crimes in fear of retaliation. For example, reporting a drug dealer may cause harm forthe reporter’s self or family. In this, an effective and efficient reporting system calledReportcoin, a novel blockchain-based incentive anonymous reporting system. ReportCoinguarantees user identity privacy and reporting message reliability throughout the reportingprocess. On the one hand, ReportCoin allows nondeterministic mobile users to vote thereporting by signing and to send anonymous announcements in the non-fully trusted network.On the other hand, ReportCoin motivates users with incentives to report without worryingabout the disclosure of identity information to be retaliated. Meanwhile, account informationand transaction records in ReportCoin are open, transparent, and tamper resistant. Thetheoretical analysis and extensive experimental results show that ReportCoin is efficient andpractical

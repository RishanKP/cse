Centralized Social Networks (CSNs) such as Facebook and Google+ have tens of millions of users using them every day. Once the user submits his/her personal information/data to these websites, it is stored on the site’s servers, completely out of the user’s control.Using Cloud Storage to store relevant data and to ensure that the user have complete control over his/her data is one of the alternatives for this problem.
Data is the asset of the modern world.But large multinational organisation consider the data provided by the users as the asset of the company without considering the users privacy.They use this data to plan various purposes like digital marketing,market analysis,sentimental analysis etc.Cambridge Analytica is an example for the exploitation of the user’s data for their own purpose. Through this project we are trying to implement a system were the proposed API assures that the control of the data in the hands of the user.This project uses the Cloud Storage Technology to store the data of the user by user’s own cloud account.The whole data stored in the cloud will be encrypted using clouds inherited encryption techniques.As a primary phase of the project this project are mainly focuses on the image data of the user.Since cloud Storage is the core part of the this project in order to reduce the load on the connection link.Wavelet Compression technique is used for image Coding.

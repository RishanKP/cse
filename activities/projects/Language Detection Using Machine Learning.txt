Spoken Language Identification is the process of detecting the language of utterance by an anonymous
speaker, irrespective of gender, accent and pro�nunciations.Implementation of an acoustic model for
Spoken Language Iden�tification is to be carried out in this project. The major task is to identify those
features or parameters which could be used to clearly distinguish be�tween languages. The system uses
Support Vector Machine (SVM) to thehandle the problem of multi class classification. The project aims
at detecting English and Malayalam. Experiments were conducted by forming a speech samples
obtained from recorded dataset. The entire dataset is split into two sets, larger unit as the training
dataset and a smaller set as the test set.

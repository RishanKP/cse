The healthcare industry collects huge amounts of healthcare data which,
unfortunately, are not "mined" to discover hidden information for
effective decision making. Data mining has been a current trend for
attaining diagnostic results. Huge amount of unmined data is collected
by the healthcare industry in order to discover hidden information for
effective diagnosis and decision making. Data mining is the process of
extracting hidden information from massive dataset, categorizing valid
and unique patterns in data. Researchers all over the world are working
in either multi agents or in ontologies for developing system in health
care domain. It might have happened so many times that you or
someone need doctor help but they are not available due to some
reason. The health management system is an end user support and
online consultation project. Here we propose a system that allows users
to get guidance on their health issues through an intelligent health care
online system. The objective of our paper is to predict disease using
clustering technique, K-means algorithm. The patient symptoms is
collected from the user to predict various disease by using data mining
techniques.
